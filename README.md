# Flight Management System

## Overview
This project is a simple Flight Management System that allows users to manage flight details, such as flight numbers, destinations, available seats, and departure/arrival times. The program reads and saves flight data to and from a text file (`flights.txt`).

## Features
- Save flight details to a text file.
- Manage flight availability for economy and business classes.
- Simple and efficient storage mechanism.

## Objectives
- Provide a basic example of file I/O operations in C++.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C++ and file I/O operations.

## Instructions for Running
1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o FlightManager main.cpp
Ensure the flights.txt file is in the same directory as the executable (if reading data).
